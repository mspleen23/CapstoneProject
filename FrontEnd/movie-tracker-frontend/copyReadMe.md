Capstone Details: 

This final assignment is a reminder to double-check everything you have done so far, and finish any remaining tasks over the next eight days. Be sure to reference the requirements outlined below to ensure your project meets the technical criteria outlined.
Your project vision and its implementation likely changed substantially from the planning phase many weeks ago. Check in again with your instructor to make sure that you are on pace for success by the end of this final project phase.
Finishing Up
Reference your original project plan and any notes you have made for yourself since then. Ensure that you have time to complete all of the tasks you outlined for yourself. Prioritize well, and if you cannot finish everything, decide what is most important.
As you finish building your application, ask yourself the following questions:
Did you deliver a project that met all of the technical requirements?
Given what the class has covered, did you build something reasonably complex?
Did you add a personal touch or a creative element into your project submission?
Did you deliver something of value to the end-user (not just a login button and an index page)?
Did you follow the code style guidance and exercise best practices?
Did you provide an appropriate level of comments?
Did you try to deploy your application to a public URL as a personal stretch goal?
Lastly, congratulations! You have come incredibly far in a very short period of time. Be proud.
